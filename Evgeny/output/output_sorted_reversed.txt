And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.

A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.

You are welcome, masters; welcome, all: — I am glad to see thee
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
And you are stay'd for. There, — my blessing with thee!
Why seems it so particular with thee?
For what advancement may I hope from thee,
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
But bear me stiffly up. — Remember thee!

And liegemen to the Dane.

Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
O, wonderful!
As we have warranties: her death was doubtful;
And my imaginations are as foul
O my prophetic soul!
The inward service of the mind and soul
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
O, step between her and her fighting soul, — 
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
To take him in the purging of his soul,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
 God ha' mercy on his soul!
The devil take thy soul!
Even with the very comment of thy soul
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;

 Now falls on Priam. — 
That can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem;
This sudden sending him away must seem

Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,
And not where I had aim'd them.

And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him,
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him, — 
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
This night to play before him.
O heavenly powers, restore him!
[Within.] Heaven secure him!
I did very well note him.
And will not let belief take hold of him
A piece of him.
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
Ay, sir, what of him?
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
Pray you, be round with him.
[Grappling with him.]
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
No more to undertake it, — I will work him
him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
We cannot get from him.
Did not together pluck such envy from him
Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
And thus a while the fit will work on him;
You must not put another scandal on him,
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him. —
Addicted so and so;' and there put on him
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him:
Pleasant and helpful to him!
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
 'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
Is the great love the general gender bear him;
For love of God, forbear him!
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
To our most valiant brother. So much for him, — 
Speak loudly for him. — 
My lord, that would dishonour him.
 Anon he finds him,
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
Well, we shall sift him.
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! — I knew him,
Nay, let's follow him.
Did you assay him
But not by him.
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. —

No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;

Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
In filial obligation, for some term

And there assume some other horrible form

But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
